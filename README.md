# RPS-Multiplayer
This is my assignment for bootcamp. A Rock Paper Scissors game will be completely functional using firebase in order to make it multiplayer.

-Instructions

 * Two users can play at the same time.

  * Both players pick from `rock`, `paper` or `scissors`. After the players make their selection, the game will tell them whether a tie occurred or if one player won.

  * The game will track each player's wins and losses.

  * Throw some chat functionality in there! No online multiplayer game is complete without having to endure endless taunts and insults from your jerk opponent.
  
  *Ejoy.
